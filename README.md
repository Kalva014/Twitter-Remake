# Description
* Implementation is pretty straightforward as I added a description above each function and used the same HTML and CSS for lab 1

# Features
* Uses Fetch API / AJAX / other equivalents to poll the provided server to receive Tweets
* Periodically updates (every 5+ seconds) the user interface with the most recent Tweets. There should not be any duplicate Tweets Presents the Tweets in a reasonable, readable format: Tweets must be clearly separated, Author (name and image), date (in readable format), and text content must be presented for each Tweet
* A user must be able to pause and unpause the feed
* A user must be able to provide a search keyword which filters the feed by text content on input value change, and this functionality works with the pause/unpause feature
* The feed must continue to grow in size for as long as there are non-duplicate tweets being polled from the server.
